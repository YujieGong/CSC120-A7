Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For the cafe class, I create an overload method for the sellCoffee method, to allow users input not only integer but also double and an overload constructor for class, to give user options to input the the values for the variables nCoffeeOunces, nSugarPackets, nCreams and nCups. 

For the House class, an overload constructor is added so that users can input if the house has the dining hall. The method is needed because some houses have dining halls while others are not. So user should have the option to input if the house has dining hall. Another overload method for Moveout is created, because user might not input the name of the person that moved out, but also they might input the index of the resident that moves out. So the overload method can accept the input as number and removes the name according to the index. 

In the library class, an overload constructor is added to the Library class which can allow user to either input the number of floors or not. An overload method is also added to the removeTitle method, which allows user to remove either one book or two books. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think all the parts of my code work as the instruction. I suggestion is try to think about the functionality of real world map while doing this homework.
